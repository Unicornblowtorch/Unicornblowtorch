Hi/Bonjour/Hola/こにちは, I’m @Unicornblowtorch. If you're interested, the name comes as a response to my wife's instagram account. 

My interest in programming came, like many others, during the pandemic. I've been curious about programming for a long time, but only during the pandemic did I \
start learning. I find that programming is a lot like learning foreign languages (which, if you couldn't tell, is something I like to do in my spare time!) \
I'm still figuring out what exactly my interest in programming is, but I'm really curious about two diverse topics: how programming can help make an impact in \
the fight against climate change, and low-level programming. Like I said, mere curiousity at this point, but hoping that I can actually start exploring the two \
topics with my depth as I get better at programming. 

I'm currently learning python.

I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will bring me real world experience.
